  My past experiences have made me realize how fragile a person can be. Working with people with disabilities, I have noticed that such people are living without certain functions that are streamlined in those without disabilities. Also, sometimes people with disabilities have greater senses that makes them super acceptable to other functions and processes. I have learned to be very serious with both the skill and non skill of  people.
I think computer programming is where I stand today for which my skills have led. I have been toughened working with others and also have become patient with working with others. I think these skills can lead me to carve a niche writing software for a particular purpose for a varying audience. 
  I joined Actualize to further develop the ability to think like a software engineer. I want to be able to work with a team, listen to others, and say "Hey, I understand this, let me create such and such". This axiomatic thought is similiar to a heroic scene or movie where a person under pressure is asked to perform a task (like fly a plane theyve never flown before or protect people during a tornado) and have a successful outcome. I hitherto believe my experiences have had a greater purpose as has been explained through a software engineering role. 
I also embark on this journey from a very psychological standpoint. I want to be able to converse and colloborate on products that change the psychology of others. Whether thats working with data, styling data or creating processes to get new data, it is riveting to me to create/change psychology. I find it mentally stimulating (and taxing) but believe the mental aspect of challenge has led me to this field and to this stage in life.

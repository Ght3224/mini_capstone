The challenges I have overcome in my life are starting college and obtaining jobs.
I got through them because I have a strong support system though my family. I have people that I can talk to and they have steered me in the right way. I have become strong minded and have been able to make the right decisions through them.  


The thing that I appreciate the most about myself is my ability to care for others and help them when they are struggling. What I don't appreciate is my sometimes extra focus on helping others when I need to assess situations more thoroughly and not give as much effort. 


Some time in my life where I have been uncomfortable was at the beginning of my freshman year in college. I know I am feeling those things when my usual bodily movements, however small, are slowed down and I don't have as much energy. 


I cope with those feelings with mostly thinking about positive things. Ways that I am able to move forward with those goals despite the feelings are taking timeout to think, as mentioned above, and then making a plan so that positive feedback is attained and the previous negative experience wanes.
